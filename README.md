## Trebuchet coding challenge

This challenge reads a text input file (input.txt) and performs two different operations:
	•	Part 1: Extracts the first and last digit from each line and calculates the total sum.
	•	Part 2: Similar to Part 1 but also converts number words (e.g., “one”, “two”, etc.) into digits before summing.

## Requirements:
Python 3.7+
No external dependencies

## Clone the repository

- `schema/input.txt`: Input file with sample lines
- `tests/`: Unit tests folder containing test cases for both parts

## How to Run
python3 main.py

## How to Test
